# Excel File Format

Your Excel file should have columns like these:

| **Name**      | **Email**               | **Other Columns...** |
|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| John Doe      | john.doe@example.com    | ...                  |
| Jane Smith    | jane.smith@example.com  | ...                  |

You can use any column names as placeholders in the email body (e.g., `{Name}`, `{Email}`, `{Other Columns...}`).  
ZapMail will automatically replace these placeholders with the corresponding data for each recipient.

# Example Email Body
Here is an example of an email body template using placeholders:
```bash
Dear {Name},

Thank you for being a valued customer. We are excited to share some updates with you.

Best regards,  
[Your Company Name]
```
In this example:

- {Name} will be replaced with the recipient's name from the Excel file.
- You can add more placeholders as needed, and they will be replaced with the corresponding values from the Excel file.

# Security Tips
- Use an app-specific password if your email provider supports it (e.g., Gmail).
- Avoid sharing your email credentials. Always store them securely.
- Consider using a test account for sending emails initially to ensure everything works smoothly.
